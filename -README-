Here I will describe how my code works, this script is for a fully functioning character controller

The code decides movement and how the character looks around. I decided to make it so the character can only move forward and backwards so the W and S key are used. The code “transform.position += transform.forward *Time.deltaTime *movementSpeed * acceleration” this means that the characters position will move forward over time to the power of movement speed which is set at 5 times the acceleration which is pre-set at 0.1f. This will increase gradually until movementSpeed + acceleration is larger than maxSpeed allowing the game to include acceleration.
The S button has the same code except the after transform.position, it says “-=” instead. This is because there is no variable for transform.backward, so I had to do it the math equation but reverse it.
After this I made the D and A key move clockwise and anticlockwise to the power I set which was 100* for clockwise and -100* for anticlockwise per second allowing the character to move quickly.
Finally, the character can move their rotation with the mouse too, going up and down too so they have full view. “Float x = Input.GetAxis(“Mouse X”);” means that the axis of the mouse moving on the x axis will move the position of the character through “transform.Rotate(y, x, 0);
